This is my code-base for the whole of the #100DaysOfCode!

Inside of this repository, you will be able to find any and all source code that has been created by myself in order to complete each project, from day 1 through to day 100. 

Feel free to use any of the data from the repository but if you do, please ensure that you credit me (GettyPlays) where it is needed as if I find that you have used it but haven't credited me, I will be forced to take action.


Good luck to all of you out there who are also completing the tasks set for you all to complete the challenge - I shall see you on the other side!

(If you want to talk to me in regards to any of the work that I have done inside of this repo, please send me a DM over on Twitter (URL above), if you want to start a project with me, contact me there also!)
